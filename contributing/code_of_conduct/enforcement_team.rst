Enforcement Team
================

Our Pledge
----------

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, the enforcement team
pledge to ensure that the spirit of the :doc:`Code of Conduct </contributing/code_of_conduct/index>`
is respected. Our main priority is to ensure the safety of our community members.
The second goal is to help educate the community as a whole to be aware of the CoC
and how to help implement its spirit throughout the community. In case these goals
conflict, we will prioritize safety of community members over all other goals.

If you think there is or has been a violation to the code of conduct please contact
enforcement team or if you prefer contact only individual members of the enforcement team.

About the Enforcement Team

team with candidates they see fit. The enforcement team will consist of at least
3 people. The team should be representing as many demographics as possible,
ideally from different employers.
