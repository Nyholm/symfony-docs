Enforcement team
===============

Our Pledge
----------

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, the enforcement team
pledge to ensure that the spirit of the :doc:`Code of Conduct </contributing/code_of_conduct/index>`
is respected. Our main priority is to ensure the safety of our community members.
The second goal is to help educate the community as a whole to be aware of the CoC
and how to help implement its spirit throughout the community. In case these goals
conflict, we will prioritize safety of community members over all other goals.

If you think there is or has been a violation to the code of conduct please contact
enforcement team or of you prefer contact only individual members of the enforcement team.

Members
-------

Here are all the members of the Code of Conduct enforcement team. You can contact
any of them by sending an email or tweet. You could also contact all of them at once
by emailing **coc@symfony.com**.
