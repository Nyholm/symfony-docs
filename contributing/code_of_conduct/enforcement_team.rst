About the Enforcement Team
--------------------------

The :doc:`Symfony core team </contributing/code/core_team>` appoints enforcement
team with candidates they see fit. The enforcement team will consists of at least
be 3 persons. The team should be representing as many demographics as possible,
ideally from different employers and not in a private partnership with Symfony
and/or SensioLabs.
