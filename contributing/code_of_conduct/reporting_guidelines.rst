Reporting Guidelines
====================

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct we ask that you report
it to the :doc:`enforcement team </contributing/code_of_conduct/enforcement_team>`
by emailing, twitter, in person or any way you see fit.

**All reports will be kept confidential.** In some cases we may determine that
a public statement will need to be made. If that's the case, the identities of
all victims, reporters, and the accused will remain confidential unless those
individuals instruct us otherwise.

If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate emergency
services first by calling the relevant local authorities. If you are unsure what
service or agency is appropriate to contact, include this in your report and we
will attempt to notify them.

In your report please include:

  * Your contact info for follow-up contact.
  * Names (legal, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved.
  * If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.
  * When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
  * Your account of what occurred.
  * If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a
    public IRC or Slack log), please include a link.
  * Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
  * If you believe this incident is ongoing.
  * Any other information you believe we should have.

What happens after you file a report?
-------------------------------------

You will receive a reply from the :doc:`enforcement team </contributing/code_of_conduct/enforcement_team>`
acknowledging receipt as soon as possible, but within 24 hours.

The team will immediately meet to review the incident and determine:

  * What happened.
  * Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation.
  * What kind of response is appropriate.

If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical safety,
the team's immediate priority will be to protect everyone involved. This means
we may delay an "official" response until we believe that the situation has ended
and that everyone is physically safe.

Once the team has a complete account of the events, they will make a decision as
to how to respond. Responses may include:

  * Nothing (if we determine no code of conduct violation occurred).
  * A private reprimand from the Code of Conduct response team to the individual(s)
    involved.
  * A public reprimand.
  * An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from a mailing
    list or Slack).
  * A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Symfony conference/community
    spaces (events, meetings, mailing lists, IRC, Slack, etc.)
  * A request to engage in mediation and/or an accountability plan.
  * On a case by case basis, the enforcement team might share information an incidents
    with employers or other 3rd parties in order to fulfill their mandate.

We'll respond within one week to the person who filed the report with either a
resolution or an explanation of why the situation is not yet resolved.

Once we've determined our final action, we'll contact the original reporter to
let them know what action (if any) we'll be taking. We'll take into account feedback
from the reporter on the appropriateness of our response, but our response will be
determined by what will be best for community safety.

The enforcement team keeps a private record of all incidents. By default all reports
are shared with the entire enforcement team unless the reporter specifically asks
to exclude specific enforcement team members, in which case these enforcement team
members will not be included in any communication on the incidents as well as records
created related to the incidents.

Enforcement team members are expected to inform the enforcement team and the reporters
in case of conflicts on interest and recuse themselves if this is deemed a problem.

Appealing the response
----------------------

Only permanent resolutions (such as bans) may be appealed. To appeal a decision
of the working group, contact the :doc:`enforcement team </contributing/code_of_conduct/enforcement_team>`
with your appeal and they will review the case.
